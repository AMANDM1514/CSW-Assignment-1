<!-- Q5) Create a Webpage with a Photo Showcase:
• Display three photos in a row (you can use a table for the layout).
• Each photo should have a caption below it.
• Include a blockquote with a famous quote for each photo, and make sure the author’s name is semantically emphasized using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., <strong> or <em>).
• Ensure that the quotes are properly formatted to visually resemble quotes, rather than just plain text. -->
